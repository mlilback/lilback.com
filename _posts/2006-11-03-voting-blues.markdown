I just got back from early voting, and once again I'm disgusted by the ballot. Fortunately it was still optical scan, not one of the disastrous touch-screen system. But I really can't stand seeing the majority of the races only have one candidate listed and no spot for a write-in. 




I'm sure some of my elected officials are doing a great job and that's why no one runs against them. But I can't believe that is true for all of them. My family has pretty good name recognition (I've never gone anywhere with my step-mother without running in to people who know her) and in a small town (approx 20,000) that is really all that is needed. I think I'll register myself as a candidate for something in 2008. I don't know if I'll actually campaign, but there should at least be a challenger on the ballot for every race.
