Earlier today Xcode downloaded a documentation update for Lion. I didn't think anything of it, until I needed to look up something. All of a sudden, none of my bookmarks in Xcode work!

I know Xcode bookmarks really suck. I have to remember Mac OX bookmarks are above iOS bookmarks since you can't rename them. Theoretically I could have four links to "Foundation Framework Reference" and have no way to distinguish which is which. But I still make use of them. But in my mind, blowing away a crapload of bookmarks like this must mean that no one at Apple uses them. Which in my mind, just confirms how bad they suck.

Automatic updates are nice, but not when they blow away your data and screw up your workflow.
