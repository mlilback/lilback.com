I really can't comprehend how someone can accidentally get in the express checkout lane with a full basket of groceries. And I really can't understand why the store staff doesn't say something. 




When approaching the register, you have to look to see if the light is on. The light is normally on the Express Checkout sign. And it should be pretty obvious to everyone that the only lane that cells cigarettes is an express lane! (10 items or less versus the normal 20 items or less at Wal-Mart.)




I guess I was just raised differently. Hell, I question getting in the express lane when I have 21 items, even if it would save me 5-10 minutes. Heck, even when I'm in a regular line with even half a cart of stuff, I'll always let anyone behind me with a couple items go ahead.




Another thing: why does stores still accept checks? What checking account doesn't come with a debit card? Heck, Wal-Mart doesn't even keep the checks anymore, they just run the routing and account number like a credit card number. But instead of entering a PIN or signing for the purchase, I've got to wait while someone writes out a check (that should have been written, except for the amount, while they waited in line), digs our their ID, etc.




Hell, they guy with 40+ items in the 10 item lane at Wal-Mart last week realized he forgot something after writing his check and was about to tear it up and write a new one!! With at least 6 customers behind him!




Not accepting checks would be a real win-win situation. No more waiting while people write out checks, get approval, etc. The stores don't have to worry about hot checks. And we save a few trees!
