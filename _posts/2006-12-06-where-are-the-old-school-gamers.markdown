I've been an avid game player my whole life. I helped started a gaming club in college, which I donated most of my games too. Since then, I've bought a lot of them. But as I've gotten older, I get to play them a lot less.

The biggest reason is now that I've moved back to rural, playing games isn't the biggest past time. Maybe after football and hunting season are over. But then I'd still have to compete with poker (three casinos within a 30 minute drive) and other sports. 

Even if I could find people, many of my favorite games are very complex and beyond what most people are willing to for fun. I mean, most people in this area got married young and never went to college. Hell, most people look pretty freaked out when I suggest playing Jeopardy on my playstation 2 instead of a shooter game.

I've never really understood online games. I'd much rather sit at a table with a group of people instead of at a computer. The biggest point of games, to me, is the social interaction. And as great as the Internet is, it is not a replacement for social interaction.

So, I'm going to list all the games I own in the off chance that someone from the area might do a google search for one of them and find this list. Besides the board games, I love to play Hearts and Spades. I'm open to learning any new games, as long as they aren't purely random (ala Risk). Superior strategy should have a pretty good chance of winning.
