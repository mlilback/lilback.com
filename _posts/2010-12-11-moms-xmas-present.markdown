![My New Freezer](/images/freezer.jpg)

I have an addiction. A really bad addiction. And my mom has helped to make it worse with her Christmas present, which was just delivered today from Home Depot.

My addiction is popsicles. I can't get enough of them. Sugar-free popsicles, of course, since I am diabetic. Now no other popsicle compares to a Blue Bell Bullet. They are heavenly. I've eaten 3 boxes in a couple of hours before (at 24 popsicles per box). Here in Morgantown I'm stuck with Popsicle-brand or Kroger's store brand. Both are ok, but its like comparing a cheap snack cake with the best wedding cake you've ever eaten.

I only had room for at most 6 boxes in the freezer attached to my refrigerator. I'm guessing I can easily fit twenty in the freezer she bought me. Along with frozen vegetables, of course. I can't live on popsicles alone, no matter how much I might like to.

Now if I could only find a way to fill it up with Blue Bell popsicles, I'd be in heaven.
