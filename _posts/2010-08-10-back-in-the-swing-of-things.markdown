The last few years have been pretty bad. Lots of health problems, and I haven't been able to work much at all. Just a few consulting jobs to pay the rent and medical bills. But things are looking up.





I'm starting a new business with some friends who are taking care of stuff so I can do what I do best -- develop software and write. In the two weeks since we decided to go ahead with this, I feel like I've already done more work than I did for Runtime Labs the last two years.





We're still working on a logo, but we've already got 9 products we hope to release in the next year, At least 4 of those should be released this year. Some are freeware, some are open source. We're targeting the Mac, iPhone, and iPad.





At the same time, I'm moving from Texas to Morgantown, West Virginia. Things are pretty hectic with the move & setting up the business. We've already got a U-Haul reserved for the end of the month and I've got a living room full of empty boxes to fill.





I haven't felt this psyched and motivated in over five years. Great things are coming!
