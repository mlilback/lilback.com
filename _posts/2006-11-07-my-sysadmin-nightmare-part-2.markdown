Well, we got a bit of a stay on having to move the servers, but I'm still working on it as fast as I can. I've got everything except perl modules installed on the new server. 




I've already moved: the rtlabs subversion repository, www.rtlabs.com, and all our WebObjects applications. Our databases have been moved, too, but I've got a final import of the data from the Oracle server running right now.




I'm also in the process of setting up mail and mailing lists. Then I just need to move blogs.rtlabs.com and www.lilback.com. After that, a switch of dns and all should be good.




An interesting thing I never realized: network solutions' domain registration also includes dns hosting. If you consider what a lot of places want to charge for dns hosting, that makes their registration fees pretty reasonable.
