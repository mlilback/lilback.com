[Greg Giraldo](http://ccinsider.comedycentral.com/a-tribute-to-our-dear-friend-greg-giraldo/), one of my favorite comedians of all time, died a few weeks ago. There are a lot of memorable lines from his routine that I think of all the time. And then the idea hit me that I could memorialize him by making some ringtones from albums.

I really wanted to use these for new text message alerts on my iPhone. But come to find out, those sounds aren't customizable without [jailbreaking](http://www.iphone4jailbreak.org/) your iphone. I've been staunchly against jailbreaking, until now. I'll accept the limits on what apps can be installed, or on network usage. I understand the business reasons for that. But I can see no reason why Apple doesn't allow users to install their own sounds for new text messages. There is no impact on the network whatsoever.


So until I decide to jailbreak, I'll just be using these clips for instant message notifications on my Mac. But here are the sound files for anyone else who wants to bring a little Greg Giraldo into their daily life.


The following clips are from [Midlife Vices](http://www.amazon.com/Greg-Giraldo-Midlife-Vices/dp/B002L9N4Z6/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1287076915&sr=8-2).
