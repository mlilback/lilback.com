Cell phones have been around for a long time now (I've had one for over ten years), and they've always had really nice features like a call log (incoming and outgoing), custom ring tones, etc. So why the hell haven't home phones added these features?




I really get frustrated when I can't look at my home phone to see when I made a call (don't want to bug them too often). Caller ID works fine for seeing incoming calls, but would it be that difficult to record the outgoing calls?




My current home phone has a phone book feature, but it doesn't use the phone book name when someone calls. That'd be nice for numbers without caller ID information. And my system came with two handsets -- but I have to enter the numbers in both. It gets frustrating to have to go find the other handset because I can't remember a phone number. It shouldn't be that hard to synchronize the phone books since they are both cordless and are transmitting data anyway.




This disparity is just another reason I'd love to get rid of my home phone for my cell phone.
