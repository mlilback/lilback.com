I walk out of the Blue Moose, a cafe where I've been using the wifi while I wait on my dsl to be installed, and what do I see? The Girls Gone Wild tour bus parked right in front of me. Apparently the University of West Virginia is the number 2 party school in the country, so they were filming at a club next door.

So the natural question came to mind, should I go?

I decided no. The girls hanging around looked so young, I decided I wasn't interested. Now if their moms had been there, I'd have been there in a New York minute. Another sign I'm getting old.
